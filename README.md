This is a small Python project where I built a Quiz Application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The main idea behind this project is not just to create a quiz, but to understand how classes, objects, and clean structure make programs easier to build and manage
Asks quiz questions to the user

Takes input as answers

Checks whether the answer is correct or not

Keeps track of your score

Finally shows your result

It’s simple, but it clearly shows how OOP can make even a basic project look professional and well organized.
